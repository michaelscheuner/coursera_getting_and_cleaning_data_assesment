Getting and cleaning data assesment
===================================

This is my repository for the Coursera "Getting-And-Cleaning-Data" Peer-Assesment.

## Perequesites

After downloading and unzipping the data archive "getdata-projectfiles-UUCI HAR Dataset.zip"
from the assessment-page, you end up with a directory "UCI HAR Dataset". Please make
sure that your working directory is set to this directory, for example:

setwd("/home/michael/coursera/UCI HAR Dataset")

A call of list.files() should give you the following entries:

[1] "activity_labels.txt" "features_info.txt"   "features.txt"        "README.txt"          "test"                "train"
